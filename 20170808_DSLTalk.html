		<h2>Prompt</h2>
		<p>"[The Data Services Librarian] is a newly created position in the UMass Amherst Libraries. As such, what is your vision of the top priorities?"</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Briefly: An introduction to Data Services</h2>
		<ul>
      <li>Not just for the sciences! Support for all research.</li>
			<li>Support throughout the research lifecycle - from ideas to discovery, planning to archiving and curating, documentation to visualization.</li>
			<li>Help create policy, monitor compliance, develop infrastructure.</li>
			<li>New topic for many faculty, communities, funders, publishers.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Briefly: An introduction to Data Services</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Expands on existing liaison relationships & library skills.</li>
			<li>Builds on existing conceptual frameworks -- like information literacy.</li>
			<li>Libraries have been organizing information for a long time! We have a lot to share, but a lot to do to be at the right tables.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

<!-- Section 1: Top priorities -->
<section>
	<h2>Vision of top priorities</h2>
	<p><ul>
		<li>Education, support, & how the Libraries fit in with current campus offerings.</li>
		<li>Build partnerships & bring in stakeholders.</li>
		<li>Examine our infrastructure and services & make a plan for continuous assessment.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Top priorities</h2>
	<p><strong>Education, support, & how the Libraries fit in with current campus offerings</strong></p>
	<p style = "text-align:left"><strong>Both:</strong> Getting the big picture via gap analysis and advertising what we offer.</p>
	<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Currently:</strong> Collaborate with groups on campus to improve reach; bring in outside expertise (e.g., Open Science Framework); introducing good data management practices; one-on-one consultations.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Top priorities</h2>
	<p><strong>Education, support, & how the Libraries fit in with current campus offerings</strong></p>
	<p style = "text-align:left"><Strong>Do not want to duplicate!</strong></p>
		<p style = "text-align:left">E.g., methods: ISSR & CRF; some software: ISSR;
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Top priorities</h2>
	<p><strong>Build partnerships & bring in stakeholders</strong></p>
	<p style="text-align:left">Both: Leveraging current partnerships & finding opportunities for growth</p>
	<p style="text-align:left">Currently: established relationships with institutes and schools across campus. Top partnerships include:
		<ul>
			<li>Graduate School</li>
			<li>College of Natural Sciences</li>
			<li>Office of Research Development</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Top priorities</h2>
		<p><strong>Examine our infrastructure and services...</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align:left">What do we offer? What should we offer? Where are we siloed? Where do we collaborate?</P>
		<p style="text-align:left"><strong>What can we improve?</strong></p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Top priorities</h2>
		<p><strong>...and make a plan for continuous assessment</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align:left">When new services are developed, how will we know? When we need to develop new services, how do we understand the needs of our community? When do we need to leverage cross-organizational infrastructure? Who is doing ____ already?</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Top priorities</h2>
		<p><strong>Potential challenges</strong>
		<p style="text-align:left">All priorities are interrelated, and build off of one another.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left">As reach and services grow, so too will complexity.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left">Practice what we teach: good data management in-house.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left">Will need to be mindful of sustainable growth.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left">Community adoption.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Vision building towards...</h2>
		<p style="text-align:left"><strong>A comprehensive, straightforward, centralized, patron-based approach to Data Services and research support -- across all disciplines.</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align:left">Integrate data literacy skills across the curriculum -- so we graduate data-literate students.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left">Making data-based decisions in Data Services.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Finally, Data Services can...</h2>
		<p>... add value, integrate assessment, improve reproducibility, and facilitate openness and communication in scholarship, but we need to do so thoughtfully and cognizant of existing work and workflows.</p>
