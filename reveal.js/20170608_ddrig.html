			<!-- section 1 - the big picture -->

				<section>
					<h2>The big picture: </h2>
					<p>DMPs help you:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Articulate what data you'll be collecting</li>
						<li>Document how you'll organize, protect, make accessible, and share that data</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">  <!-- notes! -->
						DMPs help you plan ahead, and also help you demonstrate that you've thought deeply about your project, and you are aware of its scope and limitations.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Ultimately</strong>, a DMP should be a useful starting point in documenting your work.</p>
					<p>NSF DMPs are currently limited to two pages.</p>
					<p>Use other, more robust documentation if you want to document more detail.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A DMP can be a great starting point for your own data protocol for your own work. Meaning, you can always write a thorough document that gets down into the nitty gritty of how you do your work, including the granular stuff like how you'll be naming your files, how often you performed backups, how you'll document your methods, and more.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<!-- section 2 - steps to approach your DMP -->

				<section><h2>Steps to approach your DMP</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>determine sponsor requirements</li>
						<li>types of data and materials collected</li>
						<li>standards for data and metadata format and content</li>
						<li>policies for access</li>
						<li>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</li>
						<li>archiving and preserving access to data, samples, and other research products</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							There are some directorates that have specific guidelines to follow when writing your DMP. But, many don't. If that's the case, use the information in the Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II.C.2.j for full policy details.

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>determine sponsor requirements</h3>
					<p>Some directorates deviate from the guidance in the GPG.</P>
						<p>This may or may not be indicated in your call.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>types of data and materials collected</h3>
					<p><strong>What you'll be collecting...</strong></p>
					<p>e.g., text, spreadsheets, images, interviews, physical collections, software, code, curriculum materials,...</p>
					<p>If using pre-existing data, document where that's coming from.</p>
        </section>
				<section>
					<h3>types of data and material collected</h3>
					<p><strong>... and how much</strong></p>
					<p>e.g., 5 GB total, 50 interviews at 500MB each, 400 spreadsheets which will on average be 100KB...</P>
					<p>Important in demonstrating you've thought ahead, and your requested resources match your data.</P>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
					<p>Document the formats your work will take.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>policies for access and sharing</h3>
					<p>Specifically - how will data be accessible while your project is active, and with your team. This section is also concerned with appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, and other rights requirements.</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</h3>
							<P>How data will be made available for others to re-use after you have completed your project?</P>
							<p>Where possible, try to find an appropriate data repository. Increasingly the standard for sharing data, data repositories have numerous benefits over storing data locally or on a website.</p>
							<p>Discipline specific, general purpose, or institutional repositories (like <a href="http://scholarworks.umass.edu/ScholarWorks"> @ UMass Amherst</a>!) are all great ways to share.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>archiving and preserving</h3>
					<p>Archiving and preserving are the final step -- when you have published your work, and your data is in its final, shareable form, it is time to store your data for long-term preservation.</p>
						<p>Archiving and preservation are time and resource intensive activities. It takes time and people to maintain servers, run checksums, migrate to new formats, and otherwise ensure the integrity of data for the long term. Look to an appropriate repository -- with appropriately redundant backups -- to meet this need. </p>
