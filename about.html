<h2>About</h2>
<p>
<p>Hi! I'm Thea (tay-yah) Atwood. I'm a librarian at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
<p>I like to help folks better their research by educating them in the practices and habits that make their data more transparent, reproducible, and sharable. I encourage researchers to think of how their research will help their communities and their world by thinking about the end -- how they will share, publish, and make accessible their research.
<p>I also like to embroider, enjoy a good cup of coffee or glass of beer, and as is library tradition, I have two very special cats.
