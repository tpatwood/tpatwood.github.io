				<section>
				<h2>Today:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The purpose of the data management plan</li>
					<li>Dissecting the data management plan</li>
					<li>Other resources</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<!-- section 1 - the purpose of the dmp -->

        <section>
					<h3>From the organization's perspective:</h3>
					<p>DMPs are a way to help:
						<ul>
							<li>Better document data</li>
							<li>Reduce duplicity</li>
							<li>Reduce waste and loss (funds, time, data)</li>
							<li>Protect fragile digital data</li>
							<li>Thoughtfully preserve and curate work; especially unique observations</li>
						</ul>

				<section>
				<h3>DMPs help you:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Articulate what data you'll be collecting</li>
						<li>Document how you'll organize, protect, make accessible, and share that data</li>
						<li>Monitor your work: As you are expected to be able to explain and defend your results, the DMP can help you stay organized and in compliance</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">  <!-- notes! -->
						DMPs help you plan ahead, and also help you demonstrate that you've thought deeply about your project, and you are aware of its scope and limitations.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Ultimately</strong>, a DMP should be a useful starting point in documenting your work.</p>
					<p>NSF DMPs are limited to two pages.
					<p>Use other, more robust documentation if you want to document more detail.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A DMP can be a great starting point for your own data protocol for your own work. Meaning, you can always write a thorough document that gets down into the nitty gritty of how you do your work, including the granular stuff like how you'll be naming your files, how often you performed backups, how you'll document your methods, and more.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<!-- section 2 - steps to approach your DMP -->

				<section><h2>Dissecting the DMP</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>determine sponsor requirements</li>
						<li>types of data and materials collected</li>
						<li>standards for data and metadata format and content</li>
						<li>policies for access</li>
						<li>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</li>
						<li>archiving and preserving access to data, samples, and other research products</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							There are some directorates that have specific guidelines to follow when writing your DMP. But, many don't. If that's the case, use the information in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II.C.2.j</a> for full policy details.
				</section>

				<!-- section 2.1 - determine sponsor requirements -->
				<section>
					<h3>determine sponsor requirements</h3>
					<p>Some directorates deviate from the guidance in the GPG.</P>
						<p>See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">the NSF's page on disseminating and sharing research results</a> for more information.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- section 2.2 - types of data and materials collected -->
				<section>
					<h3>types of data and materials collected</h3>
					<p><strong>What you'll be collecting...</strong></p>
					<p>e.g., text, spreadsheets, images, interviews, physical collections, software, code, curriculum materials,...</p>
					<p>If using pre-existing data, document where that's coming from.</p>
        </section>

				<section>
					<h3>types of data and material collected</h3>
					<p><strong>... and how much</strong></p>
					<p>e.g., 5 GB total, 50 interviews at 500MB each, 400 spreadsheets which will on average be 100KB...</P>
					<p>Important in demonstrating you've thought ahead, and your requested resources match your data.</P>
				</section>

				<!-- section 2.3 - standards for data and metadata -->
				<section>
					<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
					<p>Document the formats your work will take.</p>
					<p>Strive to avoid obsolescence -- work in file formats that are as open, well documented, and non-proprietary as possible. Or, be able to convert to open file formats by the end of your project</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
					<p>List of open file formats from Wikipedia at: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_formats">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_formats</a></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
					<p>Increasingly evident that good metadata is required for re-use of your work.
					<p>Metadata is the contextual information to help others who'd like to build off of your work understand exactly how to do so.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
						<p>Metadata examples:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://library.uoregon.edu/datamanagement/metadata_flickr.html">Flickr metadata example</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://library.uoregon.edu/datamanagement/metadata_dryad.html">Data set in  Dryad</a> and <a href="https://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.7852?show=full">full metadata view</a></li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
						<p>Look for an appropriate standard for your discipline, or use the metadata list compiled by the <a href="https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/">Research Data Alliance</a> or the <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards">Digital Curation Centre</a>.
							<p> If one doesn't exist for your discipline, <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin Core</a> and <a href="https://schema.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> are good places to start.</p>
					</section>


				<!-- section 2.4 - policies for access and sharing -->
				<section>
					<h3>policies for access and sharing</h3>
					<p>Specifically - how will data be accessible while your project is active, and with your team. This section is also concerned with appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, and other rights requirements.</p>
					<p>Include information on where data is stored, who has access to data or instrumentation, and how access will be protected.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Side note - Terms of Service and Use</h3>
					<p>Please read and understand any ToS you agree to. For example:</P>
						<blockquote>
							<small>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through Google Drive, <strong>you give Google a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.</strong> The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our services unless you delete your content. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to Google Drive.
							</small>
							</blockquote>
					</section>


				<!-- section 2.5 - re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives -->
				<section>
					<h3>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</h3>
							<P>How data will be made available for others to re-use or build off of after you have completed your project?</P>
							<p>Where possible, try to find an appropriate data repository. Increasingly the standard for sharing data, data repositories have numerous benefits over storing data locally or on a website.</p>
							<aside class="notes">
								Emailing for data is not very effective - sometimes as few as 10% of datasets are retrieved this way. (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007078). Other times, inability to access data has resulted in retractions. http://retractionwatch.com/?s=missing+data
							</aside>
			  </section>

				<section>
					<h3>re-uses, re-distribution, and derivatives</h3>
					<p>Licensing is becoming an important component, and may be required by funders.</p>
					<p>e.g., Creative Commons, GNU, MIT</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					 <h3>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</h3>
							<p>Discipline specific, general purpose, or institutional repositories (like <a href="http://scholarworks.umass.edu/ScholarWorks"> ScholarWorks @ UMass Amherst</a>!) are all great ways to share. Your discipline may have other methods that are valid, too (e.g., gitHub), just note that not all repositories are created equal (e.g., gitHub is NOT for long-term storage).</p>
							<p>Ideally, your data will be linked with the publication it underlies.</P>
								<aside class="notes">
									Increasingly, journals are asking to see your data, or at least have it be accessible to others for purposes of replication or re-use.
								</aside>
				</section>


				<!-- section 2.6 - archiving and preserving -->
				<section>
					<h3>archiving and preserving</h3>
					<p>Archiving and preserving are the final step -- when you have published your work, and your data is in its final, shareable form, it is time to store your data for long-term preservation.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>archiving and preserving</h3>
						<p>Archiving and preservation are time and resource intensive activities. It takes time and people to maintain servers, run checksums, migrate to new formats, and otherwise ensure the integrity of data for the long term. Look to an appropriate repository -- with appropriately redundant backups -- to meet this need. </p>
						<p>This is also a point when, if you haven't seen so yet, you'll see the benefits of good documentation and metadata!</p>
