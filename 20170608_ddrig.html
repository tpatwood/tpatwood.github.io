				<section>
				<h3>DMPs help you:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Articulate what data you'll be collecting</li>
						<li>Document how you'll organize, protect, make accessible, and share that data</li>
					</ol>
					<p>As you are expected to be able to explain and defend your results, the DMP can help you stay organized and in compliance</p>
					<aside class="notes">  <!-- notes! -->
						DMPs help you plan ahead, and also help you demonstrate that you've thought deeply about your project, and you are aware of its scope and limitations.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Ultimately</strong>, a DMP should be a useful starting point in documenting your work.</p>
					<p>NSF DMPs are currently limited to two pages.</p>
					<p>Use other, more robust documentation if you want to document more detail.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A DMP can be a great starting point for your own data protocol for your own work. Meaning, you can always write a thorough document that gets down into the nitty gritty of how you do your work, including the granular stuff like how you'll be naming your files, how often you performed backups, how you'll document your methods, and more.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<!-- section 2 - steps to approach your DMP -->

				<section><h2>Dissecting the DMP</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>determine sponsor requirements</li>
						<li>types of data and materials collected</li>
						<li>standards for data and metadata format and content</li>
						<li>policies for access</li>
						<li>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</li>
						<li>archiving and preserving access to data, samples, and other research products</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							There are some directorates that have specific guidelines to follow when writing your DMP. But, many don't. If that's the case, use the information in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II.C.2.j</a> for full policy details.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>determine sponsor requirements</h3>
					<p>Some directorates deviate from the guidance in the GPG.</P>
						<p>See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">the NSF's page on disseminating and sharing research results</a> for more information.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>types of data and materials collected</h3>
					<p><strong>What you'll be collecting...</strong></p>
					<p>e.g., text, spreadsheets, images, interviews, physical collections, software, code, curriculum materials,...</p>
					<p>If using pre-existing data, document where that's coming from.</p>
        </section>

				<section>
					<h3>types of data and material collected</h3>
					<p><strong>... and how much</strong></p>
					<p>e.g., 5 GB total, 50 interviews at 500MB each, 400 spreadsheets which will on average be 100KB...</P>
					<p>Important in demonstrating you've thought ahead, and your requested resources match your data.</P>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
					<p>Document the formats your work will take.</p>
					<p>Strive to avoid obsolescence -- work in file formats that are as open, well documented, and non-proprietary as possible. Or, be able to convert to open file formats by the end of your project</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>standards for data and metadata</h3>
					<p>Increasingly evident that good metadata is required for re-use of your work. Look for an appropriate standard for your discipline, or use the metadata list compiled by the <a href="https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/">Research Data Alliance</a> or the <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards">Digital Curation Centre</a>.
					</section>

				<section>
					<h3>policies for access and sharing</h3>
					<p>Specifically - how will data be accessible while your project is active, and with your team. This section is also concerned with appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, and other rights requirements.</p>
					<p>Include information on where data is stored, who has access to data or instrumentation, and how access will be protected.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</h3>
							<P>How data will be made available for others to re-use after you have completed your project?</P>
							<p>Where possible, try to find an appropriate data repository. Increasingly the standard for sharing data, data repositories have numerous benefits over storing data locally or on a website.</p>
			  </section>

				<section>
					 <h3>re-use, re-distribution, and derivatives</h3>
							<p>Discipline specific, general purpose, or institutional repositories (like <a href="http://scholarworks.umass.edu/ScholarWorks"> ScholarWorks @ UMass Amherst</a>!) are all great ways to share.</p>
							<p>Ideally, your data will be linked with the publication it underlies.</P>
								<aside class="notes">
									Increasingly, journals are asking to see your data, or at least have it be accessible to others for purposes of replication or re-use.
								</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>archiving and preserving</h3>
					<p>Archiving and preserving are the final step -- when you have published your work, and your data is in its final, shareable form, it is time to store your data for long-term preservation.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>archiving and preserving</h3>
						<p>Archiving and preservation are time and resource intensive activities. It takes time and people to maintain servers, run checksums, migrate to new formats, and otherwise ensure the integrity of data for the long term. Look to an appropriate repository -- with appropriately redundant backups -- to meet this need. </p>
